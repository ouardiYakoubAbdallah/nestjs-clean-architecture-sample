## Usecases

Usually it's one use case for one endpoint. In this example, we have 5 endpoints so we need 5 use cases. Why one use case for one endpoint? For the simple reason, if you have a monolithic code and you want to move on serverless, each use case will be one function (lambda, GCP function, firebase function,â€¦) or if one use case has to be exported to another API ( could be a lambda ) you will copy past your use case, inject the dependency (logger, repository) and the logic will be done.
